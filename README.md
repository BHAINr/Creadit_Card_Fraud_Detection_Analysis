# Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook presents an analysis of credit card transactions to identify and understand fraudulent activities. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

1. **Import Libraries:**
    - Essential Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

2. **Load and Explore the Data:**
    - Load the credit card transaction dataset and explore its structure.

3. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning Data:**
    - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform any necessary data preprocessing.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Visualize the distribution of features, especially the target variable (fraud or not fraud).
    - Explore other features using plots and visualizations.

5. **Feature Scaling:**
    - Scale numerical features to bring them to a similar scale.

6. **Train-Test Split:**
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

7. **Model Training:**
    - Train a Random Forest classifier to predict fraudulent transactions.

8. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy.

9. **Further Analysis:**
    - Explore additional techniques, such as anomaly detection algorithms or fine-tuning the model.

## Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook CreditCardFraudAnalysis.ipynb
    ```

3. Execute the cells in order to perform the analysis step by step.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the distribution of credit card transactions and the effectiveness of the machine learning model in detecting fraudulent activities. Results are documented in the notebook.

Feel free to explore and modify the notebook based on your specific dataset and requirements.
